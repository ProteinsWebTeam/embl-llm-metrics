The C11 family of peptidases is characterized by a conserved catalytic triad consisting of a cysteine residue, a histidine residue, and an asparagine residue.  The catalytic triad is essential for the enzymatic activity of the C11 peptidases.  The PmC11 enzyme is a monomer, and its structure consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa.  The structure of PmC11 is composed of a central beta-barrel domain and a C-terminal alpha-helix domain.  The beta-barrel domain is composed of six beta-strands, and the alpha-helix domain is composed of four alpha-helices.  The C11 family of peptidases is widely distributed among eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, and fungi. \n\n### OUTPUT \n<annotation entity=\"PmC11\" type=\"protein\"/>\n<annotation entity=\"C11\" type=\"protein_type\"/>\n<annotation entity=\"cysteine\" type"]], "filtered_resps": [["<annotation entity=\"PmC11\" type=\"protein\"/>", "<annotation entity=\"C11\" type=\"protein_type\"/>"]], "doc_hash": "a1324c9a12b89ad473b07c90008c7a225bb63aa7dad02f1cf8240b6ebb80c1a5", "prompt_hash": "390b33f3e22cf12d599b9633d535ddbe4bc9c3818e0a514da8bd9cc8226eecd6", "target_hash": "f583380d1c4346238e16516ead8caad6fad9f6d7754a13c4780038bd74dcc30b", "recall": 0.5}

The RRM domain of U2AF65 also contains a conserved phenylalanine residue at position 47 (Phe47) that is important for the recognition of the Py signals.  The structure of the RRM domain of U2AF65 in complex with a Py signal RNA has been determined by X-ray crystallography.  The structure reveals that the Arg52 and Phe47 residues are positioned in a manner that allows them to make specific contacts with the RNA.  The structure also shows that the RRM domain of U2AF65 contains a conserved tyrosine residue at position 57 (Tyr57) that is involved in the recognition of the Py signals.  The recognition of the Py signals by the RRM domain of U2AF65 is also influenced by the presence of a conserved asparagine residue at position 63 (Asn63).
