The IDA peptide is recognized by the HAESA ectodomain, which is the part of the protein that is outside the cell membrane. The IDA peptide binds to the HAESA ectodomain, which then activates the kinase domain inside the cell, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to organ shedding. The HAESA ectodomain is composed of 21 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are structural motifs that help the protein recognize and bind to specific ligands. The LRRs are arranged in a specific way to form a hormone binding pocket that can accommodate the IDA peptide. The IDA peptide is a 12-amino acid peptide that is cleaved from a larger precursor protein. The binding of IDA to HAESA is mediated by a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The HAESA protein is a dimer, meaning it is composed of two identical subunits.
